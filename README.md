crawler
=======

This project did two things:

1. Use JTomato (https://github.com/geeordanoh/JTomato) to crawl the movie metadata from Rotten Tomatos API and insert into the movie table.
2. Use twitter4j (https://github.com/yusuke/twitter4j) to crawl tweets from Twitter API and insert into the tweet table.

Please include JTomato and twitter4j.
